Description: Most excellent tools for running fish population models
             using 'Awatea', which is a variant of 'Coleraine' modified
             by 'Allan Hicks' and 'Paul J. Starr'. The Sweave manipulation
             is wizardly without resorting to 'Wickhamistic' machinations
             from 'Mordor'.

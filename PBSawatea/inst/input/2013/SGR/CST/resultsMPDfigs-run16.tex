\onefig{survResWCHGSynoptic}{Residuals of fits of model to WCHG synoptic survey series (MPD values). Vertical axes are standardised residuals. The three plots show, respectively, residuals by year of index, residuals relative to predicted index, and normal quantile-quantile plot for residuals (horizontal lines give 5, 25, 50, 75 and 95 percentiles).}

\onefig{commAgeResids}{Residual of fits of model to commercial proportions-at-age data (MPD values).  Vertical axes are standardised residuals. Boxplots show, respectively, residuals by age class, by year of data, and by year of birth (following a cohort through time). Boxes give interquartile ranges, with bold lines representing medians and whiskers extending to the most extreme data point that is $<$1.5 times the interquartile range from the box. Bottom panel is the normal quantile-quantile plot for residuals, with the 1:1 line, though residuals are not expected to be normally distributed because of the likelihood function used; horizontal lines give the 5, 25, 50, 75, and 95 percentiles (for the total of 1550 residuals).}

	in fisheries. Performance is evaluated with respect to fish life
	history type, level of stock depletion, data quality, and autocorrelation
	in recruitment strength. We quantify the robustness of each MP with
	respect to the various observation processes. Methods using observations
	of absolute biomass or stock depletion offer the best overall performance
	and this is consistent across life history types, data qualities,
	and stock depletion levels. Simple MPs can outperform conventional
	data-limited methods and data-rich assessments that use time-series
	of catch and effort data. MP performance is most sensitive to biases
	in catch data. Our results indicate that often tuning MPs for specific
	stocks is important, though this may not be viable in data-poor assessment
	scenarios because of insufficient data and analysis resources.},

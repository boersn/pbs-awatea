\section*{History of Runs}

{\tt Run01}: 1 survey (west coast Haida Gwaii (WCHG)). No CPUE series, fix $M_s$ and $h$, estimate commercial and survey1 selectivities. \newline  

\noindent {\tt Run02}: Like {\tt Run01} but $M_s$ and $h$ estimated. \newline

\noindent {\tt Run03}: Like {\tt Run02} and changing the 1997 Ocean Selector doorspread from 76.3m to 61.6m. \newline

\noindent {\tt Run04}: Like {\tt Run03} but sensitivity run S1: increasing catches 87-90 ($+10\%$), 91-92 ($+40\%$) and 93-95 ($+60\%$). \newline

\noindent {\tt Run05}: Like {\tt Run03} but sensitivity run S2: decreasing catches 84-90 ($-50\%$). \newline

\noindent {\tt Run06}: Like {\tt Run03} but sensitivity run S3: including CPUE series. \newline

\noindent {\tt Run07}: Like {\tt Run03} but using only WCHG Synoptic surveys (removing 1997 Ocean Selector). \newline

\noindent {\tt Run08}: Like {\tt Run03} but with 1997 Ocean Selector doorspread changed from 61.6m to 54.4m. \newline


\noindent **Proposed base run before the catch was corrected:

\noindent {\tt Run09}: Like {\tt Run02} and {\tt Run03} but with 1997 Ocean Selector doorspread set to 76.6m (slight change from {\tt Run02}).  \newline

\noindent **Proposed senstivity runs before the catch was corrected:

\noindent {\tt Run10}: Like {\tt Run09} but sensitivity run S1: increasing catches 87-90 ($+10\%$), 91-92 ($+40\%$) and 93-95 ($+60\%$). \newline

\noindent {\tt Run11}: Like {\tt Run09} but sensitivity run S2: decreasing catches 84-90 ($-50\%$). \newline

\noindent {\tt Run12}: Like {\tt Run09} but sensitivity run S3: including CPUE series. \newline

\noindent {\tt Run13}: Like {\tt Run09} but sensitivity run S4: including 54$^\circ$N Historical survey. \newline

\noindent {\tt Run07}: Like {\tt Run09} but sensitivy run S5: removing 1997 Ocean Selector survey. Already done above as {\tt Run 07}. \newline

\noindent **NEW base run, with corrected catch**

\noindent {\tt Run14}: Like {\tt Run09} but with corrected catch.  \newline

\noindent **Proposed senstivity runs with corrected catch:

\noindent {\tt Run15}: Like {\tt Run14} but sensitivy run S1: removing 1997 Ocean Selector survey. \newline

\noindent {\tt Run16}: Like {\tt Run14} but sensitivity run S2: decreasing catches from 1984-1990 by $-50\%$ for some vessels, and $-10\%$ for the rest. **Think still waiting to hear from Paul exactly what to do. \newline

\noindent **Problems with catch data require new exploratory runs:

\noindent {\tt Run15}: Like {\tt Run14} but with Leaman's maximum estimates of foreign catch from 1965 to 1977.  \newline

\noindent {\tt Run16}: Like {\tt Run14} but using Leaman's foreign (USSR, Japanese) catches from 1965 to 1977.  \newline

\noindent **NEW base run, with corrected catch (yet again), re-start series at 20

\noindent {\tt Run20} As for {\tt Run14}, but using Japanese catch from Ketchen (1980a) and USSR catch from Ketchen (1980b). \newline

\noindent {\tt Run21}: Like {\tt Run20} but sensitivity run S1noAge: removing 1997 Ocean Selector survey index point, but not the age data. \newline

\noindent {\tt Run22}: Like {\tt Run20} but sensitivity run S2: decreasing catches 1984 ($-19\%$), 1985 ($-18\%$), 1986 ($-27\%$), 1987 ($-10\%$), 1988 ($-11\%$), 1989 ($-15\%$). \newline

\noindent {\tt Run23}: Like {\tt Run21} but sensitivity run S1withAge: removing the 1997 Ocean Selector age data, in addition to the survey index point. \newline

% **NOT DONE YET: Use priors for selectivity parameters based on posteriors from QCS (see {\tt POP12SelPrior.pdf}), which works out normal distribution priors, but in the input files they were set as uniforms. So not sure which we are going to use.

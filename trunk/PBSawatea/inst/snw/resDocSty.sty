% resDocSty.sty - Unoffocial LaTeX style file for Canadian 
%  Science Advisory Secretariat Research Documents.
% Andrew Edwards, Andrew.Edwards@dfo-mpo.gc.ca, 17th January 2012.

% Need to merge with Jaclyn's latest. 29th March 2012***

% This is not an official template, but my attempt at developing
%  the correct CSAS formatting for Research Documents. 

% I haven't attempted to format the first few pages, seems easier
%  to stick with the Word 'template' RES2011_nnn-eng.doc 
%  (which looks like it might change every year), available at
%  http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/process-processus/res-docs-rech/index-eng.htm

% This means that the CSAP/CSAS people can insert things like the
%  Res Doc number and French translation of title and abstract.

% Not yet sure how to deal with the Table of Contents for a full
%  LaTeX document. This is optional (though no doubt preferred), 
%  and needs to come before the Abstract/Resume. Maybe best to
%  have it done automatically in LaTeX for the Working Paper 
%  (submitted for the review meeting), then manually create it in
%  the Word file (based on the automatic LaTeX one) for the final
%   Res Doc submission?

% I should tidy this up somewhat but am short of time. The output
%  is a mixture of useful text related to the style, and some
%  text from assessments and papers to give enough text to 
%  see how paragraphs etc. look.

% Basing style settings on the CSAS guide RES2011_nnn-eng.doc.

% ** Packages **
% For installation, the caption package said to look at the 
%  following three, but I didn't find them helpful:
% If you need help for installation please visit:
% http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=inst-miktex*
% http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=installthings
% http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=privinst

% For caption it took me a while, it seems that you can't just
%  simply download a .sty file and stick it in the right
%  directory, there are things called .dtx and .ins files 
%  instead. I use MikTex, but the automatic installer didn't
%  seem to work.
% I ended up downloading the caption package as a .zip file,
%  unzipping and moving the folder to 
%  C:Program Files/MiKTeX 2.6/tex/latex/caption, 
%  then in there ran latex caption.ins, which (finally) created
%  the .sty files from the .ins files. 
%  Then have to refresh FNDB: Start-Programs-MikTex-Settings.

\usepackage{nccmath}    % from web for fleqn
\usepackage{natbib}     % need for bibliography 
\usepackage[pagewise]{lineno}     % if you want to add line numbers in
\usepackage[top=1in, bottom=1in, left=1in, right=1in]{geometry} 
			%  page margins
\usepackage{fancyhdr}   % to add in headers and footers
\usepackage[format=plain, indention=0.5cm, labelsep=period, font={small, it}, justification=raggedright, singlelinecheck=false]{caption}
  			% to change settings, see caption-eng.pdf.
\usepackage{tocloft}        % Table of Contents

\captionsetup[table]{position=above, skip=5pt}
			% To have less whitespace after Table
			%  caption. 'above' tells it to put the 
			%  skip after caption, but you may still
			%  need to have the caption before
			%  the table in .tex.
\usepackage{epsfig}     % for epsfbox

\raggedright		% For ragged right margins (yes, ugly, 
			%  but that's the rules, which of course
			%  exist because right justified in Word
			%  always looks so bad).
			% I had also tried the newer \RaggedRight
			%   from the ragged2e package, but it 
			%   seems to introduce lots of hyphens.
% \usepackage{ragged2e}   % For RaggedRight which is apparently
			%  a better word-breaking algorithm, 
			%  (raggedright tries to avoid hyphens).
			% You actually need the ms package (Martin
			%  Schroeder), as ragged2e calls others.
% \RaggedRight

% Headers and footers - see \lhead etc. at the start of .tex
\pagestyle{fancy}
\renewcommand{\footrulewidth}{0.4pt}
\renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0pt}
% For Res Doc, best to have a left and a right footer (header), not
%  just one (for double-sided printing). Though I remember from my
%  thesis there's a way to make it a header always be on the 
%  'outside' corner, so have a Google around.

\setlength\parindent{0pt}    % To not indent paragraphs.
\parskip 2ex   % was 3ex     % To increase white space between 
			     %  paragraphs (since not indenting).
                             % For POP 2011 I did this, presumably
                             %  because we did it in the Word version.

\def\headc{\vspace{-2ex}} % contraction after 'fake' subsubheading
% \def\subsub#1{\noindent {\bf #1} \headc}    % fake subsubheading
